# Firebase Analytics Agent

An end-to-end agent that adds **Firebase Analytics** to any **Flutter** app.

It reads the codebase (and optionally a Figma file), proposes a tracking plan as an **Excel sheet you approve**, writes a technical implementation plan, and then **implements it dev-first** — following the project's own conventions (Bloc or Riverpod, `get_it`/`injectable`, flavors). It never commits or pushes.

---

## How it works (the big picture)

```
Your Flutter project
       │
       ▼
  fa analyze          ← agent reads every screen, route, cubit, bloc
       │                 and proposes events in a spreadsheet
       ▼
  tracking.xlsx        ← YOU open this and mark each event 1 (do it) or 0 (skip)
       │
       ▼
  fa plan             ← agent reads your approvals and writes a technical plan
       │
       ▼
  IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  ← YOU review and edit if needed
       │
       ▼
  fa firebase         ← agent connects the Firebase dev project (idempotent)
       │
       ▼
  fa implement        ← agent writes all the Dart code (DEV flavor only, on a branch)
       │
       ▼
  You test in DebugView  ← run the dev flavor, confirm events appear in Firebase
       │
       ▼
  fa promote-prod     ← agent mirrors the wiring to the PROD flavor
```

The agent runs on your machine and edits your repo directly. You stay in control at every checkpoint.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Node 18+** | `node --version` to check |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Install from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download), then run `claude login` once |
| **Flutter project** | Bloc or Riverpod; `get_it`/`injectable` supported |
| **`flutterfire` CLI** | Only needed for `fa firebase` and `fa promote-prod` — `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli` |
| **`firebase` CLI** | Only needed for `fa firebase` and `fa promote-prod` — install from [firebase.tools](https://firebase.tools), then `firebase login` |
| **`FIGMA_TOKEN`** *(optional)* | Only if you want Figma cross-referencing during `fa analyze` |

---

## Install

```bash
# 1. Clone / navigate to the agent repo
cd path/to/firebase-analytics-agent

# 2. Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# 3. Put the `fa` command on your PATH (one-time, machine-wide)
npm link
```

After `npm link`, the `fa` command is available everywhere. No API key needed — it uses your Claude Code login.

### Optional: Figma token

Create a `.env` file in the agent repo root:

```
FIGMA_TOKEN=your_figma_personal_access_token
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Check what the agent detects about your project (no API call, instant)
fa status --project path/to/your/flutter/app

# Run the full analysis → produces tracking.xlsx
fa analyze path/to/your/flutter/app

# With Figma cross-referencing
fa analyze path/to/your/flutter/app --figma https://www.figma.com/file/...
```

---

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1 — Analyze

```bash
fa analyze path/to/flutter/app
```

The agent explores the codebase, maps every user journey, and proposes analytics events.
When it finishes, open:

```
path/to/flutter/app/.analytics-agent/tracking.xlsx
```

Fill the **Final Approvel?** column:
- `1` = implement this event
- `0` = skip it
- leave blank = undecided (agent will skip)

Save and close the file.

---

### Step 2 — Ask (optional)

Have a question about a specific event before approving?

```bash
fa ask "Should we track the OTP resend separately or fold it into otp_failed?" \
  --project path/to/flutter/app
```

The agent answers using the analysis context it already has.

---

### Step 3 — Plan

```bash
fa plan --project path/to/flutter/app
```

The agent reads your approved events and writes a technical plan to:

```
path/to/flutter/app/.analytics-agent/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

Review it. Edit if needed. Proceed when happy.

---

### Step 4 — Connect Firebase (dev)

```bash
fa firebase --dev-project your-dev-firebase-project-id \
  --project path/to/flutter/app
```

The agent is **idempotent** — if Firebase is already wired, it verifies the setup and only adds what's missing (e.g. `firebase_analytics` package). It only touches the **dev** flavor.

> If it says the `flutterfire` or `firebase` CLI is missing, install them first (see Prerequisites), then re-run.

---

### Step 5 — Implement (dev only)

```bash
fa implement --project path/to/flutter/app
```

The agent writes all the Dart code:
- `AnalyticsService` (abstract) + `FirebaseAnalyticsService` (impl)
- Event-name constants + PII sanitizer
- DI registration (`get_it`/`injectable` or Riverpod)
- Route observer for `screen_view`
- All approved log calls at the exact firing sites

Changes go on the `analytics/firebase-analytics` branch. **The agent never commits or pushes.**

Verify:
1. Run the **dev** flavor of the app
2. Open **Firebase DebugView** in the Firebase console
3. Confirm the events appear as you use the app

---

### Step 6 — Promote to prod (only when dev is verified)

```bash
fa promote-prod --prod-project your-prod-firebase-project-id \
  --project path/to/flutter/app
```

Mirrors the dev wiring exactly into the prod flavor. Same branch, no commit.

---

### Commit when done

The agent leaves all changes staged on the `analytics/firebase-analytics` branch. When you're satisfied:

```bash
cd path/to/flutter/app
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Firebase Analytics (approved events, dev-first)"
# then open a PR as normal
```

---

## All commands

```bash
fa analyze [projectPath] [--figma <url>] [--model <model>]
fa ask "<question>"      [--project <path>] [--model <model>]
fa plan                  [--project <path>] [--model <model>]
fa firebase              --dev-project <id> [--project <path>] [--model <model>]
fa implement             [--project <path>] [--model <model>]
fa promote-prod          --prod-project <id> [--project <path>] [--model <model>]
fa status                [--project <path>]
```

`[projectPath]` and `--project` default to the **current directory** if omitted.

---

## State files

Everything the agent produces lives in `<project>/.analytics-agent/` — add this to the Flutter project's `.gitignore`:

```
.analytics-agent/
```

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `tracking.xlsx` | The event plan spreadsheet (you fill Final Approvel?) |
| `tracking.json` | Machine-readable mirror of the spreadsheet |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Technical plan written by `fa plan` |
| `session.json` | Saved agent context (enables resume across CLI runs) |
| `run.log` | Full agent output log for debugging |

---

## Safety rules (enforced by the agent)

| Rule | What it means |
|------|--------------|
| **Dev-first** | `fa implement` only touches the dev flavor; prod is a separate explicit step |
| **No auto-commit** | Agent edits on a branch and stops — you review and commit |
| **No PII** | Never logs phone, email, name, avatar, national ID, card data, or GPS |
| **Idempotent Firebase setup** | Re-running `fa firebase` verifies instead of clobbering |
| **Conventions per repo** | Service placed where the repo already keeps shared services |

---

## Cost & model

Each phase uses the best model for the job by default:

| Phase | Default model | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| `fa analyze` | **Opus** | Deep codebase reasoning — needs the most capable model |
| `fa plan` | **Opus** | Designing the full technical implementation plan |
| `fa ask` | Sonnet | Q&A, much lighter task |
| `fa firebase` | Sonnet | Mostly file edits and CLI calls |
| `fa implement` | Sonnet | Follows the plan written by Opus |
| `fa promote-prod` | Sonnet | Mirrors dev wiring to prod |

You can override any phase with `--model`:

```bash
fa analyze path/to/app --model claude-sonnet-4-6   # cheaper analyze
fa implement --model claude-opus-4-8               # stronger implement
```

Or override all phases permanently in the agent's `.env`:

```
FA_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `claude: command not found` | Install Claude Code from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) and run `claude login` |
| `fa: command not found` | Run `npm link` from the agent repo, or use `node dist/cli.js <cmd>` |
| `No prior analysis found` | Run `fa analyze` first — each phase requires the previous one |
| `flutterfire: command not found` | Run `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli` |
| `firebase: command not found` | Install from [firebase.tools](https://firebase.tools) and run `firebase login` |
| Excel file locked error | Close `tracking.xlsx` in Excel before running the next phase |
| Want to re-run analysis from scratch | Delete `.analytics-agent/` in the Flutter project and re-run `fa analyze` |

## Using with Claude Code (`/firebase-analytics`)

If your team uses Claude Code, the skill is installed at `~/.claude/skills/firebase-analytics`. Just type `/firebase-analytics` in any Claude Code session — it will ask for your project path and drive the whole pipeline conversationally.
